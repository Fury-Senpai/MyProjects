The Bubble Sort Visualization project is a graphical demonstration of the Bubble Sort algorithm, developed using C++ and SDL2. The project allows users to visually understand how Bubble Sort works by observing real-time animations of the algorithm as it sorts a set of unsorted elements. This tool provides a fun and educational way to learn and explore the inner workings of one of the simplest sorting algorithms.
